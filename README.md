# http4sws #

Welcome to http4sws!

This is a simple example of working with Websockets and http4s.

The easiest way to play is to run http4sws.Http4sWS and use Chrome's Simple Websocket Client using the
url ws://localhost:8080/ws, and click _Open_. Type anything into the request field, the server will print it.
The message log will display the current time every second.
